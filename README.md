### Hello there...
- Me? Just a guy who went down the rabbit hole.
- Mostly interested in Cybersecurity, but always curious about Computers in general.
- Got a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, by the way.

### Skills?
- Most comfortable with backend stuff, frontends aren't really my forte.
- Familiar with C++, Java, JavaScript, Go  but most proficient with Python.
- Avid Linux Enthusiast. Arch linux user btw. But I like *nix systems in general including BSDs.
- Favourite areas are Networks, Operating systems and any thing related to cybersec honestly. 
- Good with quite a few tools: from pentesting tools like Metasploit and Burp Suite to forensic tools like The Sleuth Kit (TSK) and Volatility. I can also use network tools like Wireshark and Nmap, along with disassemblers like Cutter (radare2/rizin) and Ghidra.

### Currently?
- Diving into Malware analysis and reverse engineering
- Exercising my skills with CTF challenges. 
- Always testing and exploring interesting tools and looking around under the hood.

### A bit about me:
Let's just say I'm a little paranoid (for good reason). So Iâ€™m not on a lot of social media.  
Still wanna get in touch?  
Alright here's my mail: monishkumar03@protonmail.com (Nope, my birthday's not on 3rd)
